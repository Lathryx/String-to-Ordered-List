# String-to-Ordered-List

This is a short and simple Python script that I've created to convert strings into ordered lists. [Use this script online](https://repl.it/@Lathryx/String-to-Ordered-List). 

**Some features I want to add:** 
- Allow user to choose delimiter to parse string with. 
- Add the option to copy and paste the resulting text. 
- Make program reusable (easily/without need to exit and reopen program). 

Please let me know of any other features you'd like to be added via [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/CaydenWalsh3) or by [creating an issue](https://github.com/Lathryx/String-to-Ordered-List/issues/new). 

### Thanks!
